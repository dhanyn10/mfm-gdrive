### change filename by Position
#### Overview
The "Change File Name by Position" operation enables precise manipulation of filenames by specifying a start and an end position. Characters within the specified range will be removed from the filename. This operation is particularly useful for cleaning up filenames that have unwanted prefixes, suffixes, or segments in the middle.

#### How It Works
When you select "Change File Name by Position" and click "RUN", a dialog will appear prompting you to enter two values:
- Start: The 1-based numerical position where you want to begin removing characters.
- End: The 1-based numerical position where you want to end removing characters. The character at this 'end' position will also be removed.

### Insert PadStart
padStart is pads the current string with given string until meet the required length, you can read more details [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart). You can use padStart to solve problem like below:

```
file-997.pdf
file-998.pdf
file-999.pdf
file-1000.pdf
```
From the list above, set expected value with `4`. The result will become:

```
file-0997.pdf
file-0998.pdf
file-0999.pdf
file-1000.pdf
```
